# DynamicSOQL_Util
Apex utility class that has some convenient utility methods when dealing with dynamic SOQL

# Testing

`DynamicSOQL_Util_TEST.apxc` is the test class for `DynamicSOQL_Util.apxc`.

It's salesforce running tests is pretty simple.  My favorite is in the web developer console. _I recommend you
always run them asynchronously, otherwise test coverage doesn't seem to be calculated._

Write good tests.  Shoot for 100% test coverage for any new code.
